# Credit-Card-Approval-using-Machine-Learning

Credit scorecards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank can decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk. In general, credit scorecards are based on historical data. Today, due to the advancement of machine learning algorithms there are many predictions model such as Boosting, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines have been introduced into credit card scoring. Following Business issues will be addressed in this project using the below-mentioned dataset: Build a machine learning model to predict whether an applicant is eligible for a credit card, solving an Unbalanced dataset problem, Analysing the categories important for credit card eligibility, and comparing the various machine learning algorithms and their predictions and summarizing in the end.
